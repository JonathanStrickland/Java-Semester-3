  Problem 1: 5/10 - It wasn't very difficulty but it did get me thinking, but overall
              I didn't struggle with problem 1

  Problem 2: 3/10 - It wasn't difficult, it was similar to past questions so I had a decent
              understanding on where to start. Overall I didn't struggle with problem 2

  Problem 3: 6/10 - It was a bit more challenging, but over all once I started to understand
              I got it done pretty quickly. I slightly struggled with problem 3.
  
  Problem 4: 4/10 - It was very similar to problem 3, I just had to add a scalable method.
              Overall I didn't struggle with problem 4.
